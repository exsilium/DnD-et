"\\DndDropCapLine{Y}{our first step in playing an adventurer} in the Dungeons "
"\\& Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your "
"character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your "
"imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such "
"as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and "
"backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your "
"representative in the game, your avatar in the \\textsc{Dungeons \\& "
"Dragons} world."

"Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you "
"want to play. You might be a cou- rageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a "
"fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in "
"an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand "
"combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like "
"fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one "
"of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at "
"the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don’t know where else to "
"begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see what catches "
