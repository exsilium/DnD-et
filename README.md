# DnD and Estonian

[Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.

[Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language) (eesti keel [ˈeːsʲti ˈkeːl] is a Finnic language and the official language of Estonia. It is written in the Latin script, and is the first language of the majority of the country's population; it is also an official language of the European Union. Estonian is spoken natively by about 1.1 million people; 922,000 people in Estonia, and 160,000 elsewhere.

The relative small language footprint means that D&D related materials do not receive official translations. As my son is soon turning 6, I wanted to take him on his first adventure using his native language. He is quick witted and can read - but where to start if even the Basic Rules are not available for consumption. This fan-created translation of Basic Rules is made available for FREE and is aimed to get started in D&D. Mix it with a kid appropriate adventure and have fun!
